   <h3 class="posted-date-list">September 26, 2015</h3>

   <div class="body">
      When giving feedback on a piece of creative work we have to remember how exposed the designer's personal style is. Few people see, let alone have an opinion on, a software developer's code style, or a QA's regression test procedure, but visual design is incredibly visible and many people have opinions about it. To avoid getting the designer on the defensive you have to give feedback which is fundamentally specific, constructive and objective.

   <h3 class="posted-date-list">July 5, 2015</h3>

   <div class="body">
      Startups often look at processes as corporate, stodgy and antagonistic to creativity. The truth is that processes are a framework for success. What&rsquo;s needed are processes which provide flexibility, facilitate rapid learning and iteration, and act as a solid foundation for innovation. While achieving perfection is no mean feat, here are some ideas that should be kept in mind when considering product management processes: Build Measure Learn - this is core to the Lean product philosophy.

   <h3 class="posted-date-list">May 31, 2015</h3>

   <div class="body">
      As a product manager, you will undoubtedly have to critique designs and wireframes made by UX/Visual Design colleagues from a customer or technical perspective and may even find yourself required to design aspects of user interfaces. In doing so it helps to know the main principles involved in crafting a great user experience. User experience can be broken down into two main parts. The structure describes how pages on the site are organised into a structure, what information is on each page and how it is organised on the page.

   <h3 class="posted-date-list">May 26, 2015</h3>

   <div class="body">
      Adaptive planning is a strategic philosophy which aims to ensure you&rsquo;re delivering the best value in an ever-changing and unpredictable business environment. The planning phase of large projects is often discrete and comes at the start of the process. This can be a recipe for disaster if our ideas do not have the desired impact (wrong assumptions) or if during the time from conception to completion the world changes so that what you deliver is no longer important or useful.

      A sports coach knows they are doing their job well when their team wins matches, it's obvious! For a product manager signs of success are less apparent - you must have some measurable indicators of performance for your goal. A goal could be increasing conversion rate on an online shop and the metric would be the e-commerce conversion rate from Google Analytics, if you see this consistently rising then you know you are succeeding.
