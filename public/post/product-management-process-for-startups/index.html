      <p><p>Startups often look at processes as corporate, stodgy and antagonistic to creativity. The truth is that processes are a framework for success. What&rsquo;s needed are processes which provide flexibility, facilitate rapid learning and iteration, and act as a solid foundation for innovation. While achieving perfection is no mean feat, here are some ideas that should be kept in mind when considering product management processes:</p>

<ol>
 <li> <p><span class="blog-li-title">Build Measure Learn</span> - this is core to the Lean product philosophy. We are scientists looking to conduct business experiments, and every feature that gets built should be based on a testable hypothesis that solves a customer problem or moves us towards our business goals. This hypothesis should be quantitative if possible but the key is that we can track if we have been successful. I discuss how we should set SMART goals in <a href="" style="text-style:italic;">another post</a>, and what's true of goals is true of the features we choose to complete them. </p>
    <p>Some online recommend a validated learning step for every feature as part of the product development workflow to ensure that this is remembered - shipping a feature is just the start! </p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="blog-li-title">Sustain momentum</span> - momentum is very important in product development for the efficiency and morale of the team, we need to 'always be shipping'. Continuous deployment is one way of approaching this - and it means we have very frequent software releases, which also minimises the complications from integration testing lots of features together. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="blog-li-title">Think about quick wins</span> - when you prioritise features/work, you should be looking to maximise return for the amount of resource investment. Think about calculating a metric of business impact for each piece of work based on your current business goal's KPIs and divide this by a metric of the developer time required (e.g. in weeks). This is as close as we can get to an objective idea of project priority - at least the best thing the Internet is able to suggest to me :)
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><span class="blog-li-title">Less is more</span> - a trap that is easy to fall into is trying to get too many projects in progress in an attempt to appease the gods. Unfortunately, this can quickly become unworkable and disappoints stakeholders as they have expectations raised by things being in progress, but with so much in progress everything takes longer. </p><p>Aim to have at most 2 major projects in progress at any one time and get them through as fast as possible - you want to be a laser, pinpointing and solving particular problems rapidly.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="blog-li-title">Strict resource management</span> - related to 'Less is More', we need to plan a roadmap which has very realistic resource planning, when you estimate how long a feature will take, at least double this time when you put it on the roadmap, and don't put more work on the board than you will have developers for, it's not reasonable to expect them to be switching in between.
    </p>
    </li>
<li><p><span class="blog-li-title">80/20 rule</span> - the vast majority of the development time should be spent measuring and improving existing features and not chasing after shiny new features. A validated learning step/steps in the product development pipeline can help to enforce this.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="blog-li-title">Customer focus</span> - good leadership is all about having a vision and using your passion to engage people with that vision. But as a product manager, you have to be passionate about building what customers want, and should be an advocate for features which are strongly customer-requested and for an excellent customer experience. </p><p>Do bear in mind that customers are often better at describing their problem than having a vision, so look for the problems and then use your talented team to craft a creative and intuitive solution.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><p><span class="blog-li-title">Reduce silos</span> - a successful team needs lots of effective communication. The product manager cannot be the sole communication conduit between developers and the rest of the business. </p><p>Developers need to be actively talking to stakeholders and UX (and PMs!) as appropriate during their work - part of this is about making sure people feel comfortable asking questions and not knowing the answer all the time in the company culture.</p><p> On top of this, the developers need to be involved in planning meetings for features (ideation, discussion of technical challenges and scope to some degree) to feel part of a team. It's the difference between a stonemason telling you they're 'cutting stones' and them saying they're 'building a cathedral'.
</p> 
</li>
<li><p><span class="blog-li-title">Don't copy the competition</span> - Competitor benchmarking is fine where we're short on time and are stuck on a particular user experience question, or possibly to see the 'table stakes' for common functionality but we should avoid copying competitor site features directly as a product strategy. </p><p>If a company wants to differentiate themselves and take their business to the next level, then they need to think differently to the competition and do things that nobody else is doing and solve the most important problems for the customer.</p>
