As a product manager, you will undoubtedly have to critique designs and wireframes made by UX/Visual Design colleagues from a customer or technical perspective and may even find yourself required to design aspects of user interfaces. In doing so it helps to know the main principles involved in crafting a great user experience.
<p>
    <p>
        User experience can be broken down into two main parts. The <strong>structure</strong> describes how pages on the site are organised into a structure, what information is on each page and how it is organised on the page. The <strong>surface</strong> level describes how visual language of colour, imagery and formatting can be used to optimise the communication of the content to the user.
    </p>

<h3>Structural features</h3>

<p>
Structure is created by an interplay of <strong>interaction design</strong>, what information is displayed to the user on each page and what happens when the user interacts with the content, and <strong>information architecture</strong>, which is how the information on the site is organised at a higher level (types of pages and how they are grouped and navigation, including search). 
<p>
    <p>
It's very important that you have a consistent user experience, this includes the tone of the copy as well as the specific wording and labels used for features. Re-usable design patterns should be established for the site, for example for message boxes and login fields. This means that customers only have to learn how the site works once and reduces frustration.
</p>
<p>
Users of your site should also understand where they are at any time on the site, how they got there and where they can go from this point - otherwise it's like being trapped in a hall of mirrors. On a related note any interactions you have with the site should produce immediate responses that can be understood by humans - so no scary 'Fatal exceptions'!
    </p>
    <p>
Good interfaces don't put too much on the screen at once, rather use progressive disclosure of the information which makes the user experience more focussed and engaging and less confusing. In scientific terms we are maximising signal and reducing noise.
</p><p>
If you have a bad interface the product will NOT be used and you should only deviate from established convention if there is a valid reason.
</p>
<h3> Surface features - visual language</h3>
<p>
The surface is about using layout, typography, colour, imagery, sequencing and visual identity to organise, economise and communicate the information on a page in the best way to the user.
</p><p>
Colour draws the eye to the most important areas on the screen and influences our emotional response. Choosing the right colours maximises readability and minimises optical fatigue. Don't use too saturated colours even if they are complementary. Use contrast to draw attention to specific elements with an awareness that the greatest contrast areas draw the most attention first. Black, white and red have the maximum contrast of any combination.
</p><p>
If you use more than one style of font, they should be visually distinct from each other and used to denote different types of information. Areas of copy should be aligned with each other and with other elements on the page, and be in close proximity to anything they refer to.
</p>
<p>
So there is a lot to consider when designing user interfaces, and it is a lot more than simply drawing boxes. It requires an excellent command of human psychology and it is what can make or break your product, so you have to get it right.
