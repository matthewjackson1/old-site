<p>A sports coach knows they are doing their job well when their team wins matches, it's obvious! For a product manager signs of success are less apparent - you must have some measurable indicators of performance for your goal. A goal could be increasing conversion rate on an online shop and the metric would be the e-commerce conversion rate from Google Analytics, if you see this consistently rising then you know you are succeeding.

<h3> Setting Measurements </h3>

After deciding the business goals, we need to define key measurements, these provide a structure for how the goal needs to be fulfilled.
<ol>
	<li>Scale - What will we measure?</li>
	<li>Meter - How will we measure it?</li>
	<li>Benchmark - How are things now?</li>
	<li>Constraint - What is the minimum acceptable value/break-even point? There may not always be a constraint. </li>
	<li>Target - What is the desired value?</li>
</ol>
Here is an e-commerce example:<br/>
<br/>
Goal: Increase Average Order Value within next 3 months<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Scale - AOV</li>
	<li>Meter - Google Analytics AOV</li>
	<li>Benchmark - this month - £26.50</li>
	<li>Constraint - £28.50 (to cover fulfilment costs)</li>
	<li>Target - £30 (we're in da money :)!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Milestones</h3>
<p>
You need to prioritise the goals (for example via dot voting with your team) before coming up with milestones for the roadmap. Milestones are markers along the way to completing our business goals. The best advice is to focus on one goal at a time when delivering iteratively, broken down into milestones if necessary. 
</p><p>5 milestones where each one fulfils one goal fully are better than 5 where each completes 5 goals partially, this is owing to the uncertainty of the business environment - by the time you get to milestone 4, it is very likely that the business objectives will change and you won't have actually completed any of the goals and you don't care about some of them now.
</p>

E.g.
<ul>
	<li>Milestone 1 - more players, no negative impact on retention, 100% increase in IT costs possible if necessary</li>
	<li>Milestone 2 - no damage to player numbers or retention, reduce IT costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes risk will be too high to fulfil one ambitious goal at a time. In these cases, you should break down the goals into smaller milestones and alternate between different goals' milestones. For example if your goal was to increase game player numbers by 700k while not increasing IT costs, it may be better to increase player numbers by 100k (not 700k) first, and then switch to reducing IT costs, and then return to increasing player numbers by another 100k.
</p>
<p>
So there you have it - measurable goals, scheduled into achieveable milestones with a balanced risk profile. It's all so easy!
