+++

Adaptive planning is a strategic philosophy which aims to ensure you're delivering the best value in an ever-changing and unpredictable business environment. The planning phase of large projects is often discrete and comes at the start of the process. This can be a recipe for disaster if our ideas do not have the desired impact (wrong assumptions) or if during the time from conception to completion the world changes so that what you deliver is no longer important or useful.

The adaptive approach turns strategy from guesswork to science, and consists of three key principles to keep it nimble and validate our assumptions about what will help us achieve our business goals. 

<h3>Variation</h3>
<p>
This means that for each of your business objectives you should generate a large number of possible initiatives to achieve it. Let your creativity run wild and aim to look at the problem from different angles that you haven't considered previously. For example, if you want to increase conversion rates on your e-commerce website, then you should consider what the marketing team could do as well as the product development team.
</p>
<p>
After the creative thinking, you need to be logical - assess the magnitude of the potential business impact and the resource requirements for each of the initiatives and prioritise them. There will likely be some low-hanging fruit and these are the things you want to tick off first.
	</p>

<h3>Survivability</h3>
<p>Once you know what your best initiatives are, you need to test out if your assumptions about their business impact are correct. If it is a software development feature then you need to get prototypes built and get feedback from user testing to iterate on the design until you are happy with it.</p>
<p>
User story mapping (see another post) can then be carried out to find the best way to break the feature down into releases which should each be polished slices of business value (i.e not just functional, they should look good as well). By breaking the project down into releases, you can get early feedback from customers on the desired functionality and usefulness of the feature.
	</p>
<h3>
Selection
</h3>
<p>
Each release should contain ways to track the usage of the feature and customers' opinions, is there interest in it? Are people using it how we expect? What changes do they want? With the answers to such questions we can quickly feedback into our strategy. We can make an early decision to drop a feature and not waste precious development resources on it, or to amend future releases to include more highly-demanded additional functionality faster. Essentially we want to learn from our mistakes and improve and build upon our successes. </p>
</ul>

Adaptive planning is also known as the "Build, Measure, Learn" methodology, but as an ex-geneticist I love the evolutionary analogue. As product managers we are trying to 'evolve' a product to be as efficient and successful as possible, just as nature facilitates the evolution of organisms. For example, reproduction produces a huge array genetic diversity (from mutations as well as recombination), these are the 'creative ideas' of our model. Between each biological generation these are small changes from the previous generation, any larger genetic changes are generally not survivable. Finally, natural selection occurs, and the most successful genetic variants are more likely to be passed on to the next generation, product managers need to be the selective agent in product evolution, using KPIs as indicators of success. 

So there you have it, be nice to product managers, they're basically gods ;)...
