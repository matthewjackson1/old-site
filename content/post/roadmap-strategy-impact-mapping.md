     <p><p><p>
Product management is not a role many people are familiar with, but a good analogue for the job is that of a sports coach but for a software development team.</p>

<p><p> A coach's job is to make the sports team successful and to do this they must know what game they&rsquo;re playing. A coach who doesn&rsquo;t know whether the team is supposed to be playing football or tiddlywinks is not going to have any success, and it&rsquo;s the same for product managers, if they do not know what the team&rsquo;s business goal is, then they are headed for failure. </p>
<p>
A coach must also develop a game plan that will lead the players to victory. By comparison, the product manager needs to design the development strategy for their team of developers.
</p>
<p>
One recent framework for a product manager to understand what game they are playing and develop an effective strategy is known as impact mapping. It&rsquo;s supposed to to give you direction, structure and a way to use feedback to adjust the game plan continuously.
</p>
<p>
There is a four level hierarchy of planning:
<ol>
<li><span class="blog-li-title">WHY</span> - the GOALS - what we want to achieve e.g. increase conversion rate by 20% by next March. The best goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic and Timely and broken down into milestones (read more about this here).</li>
    <li><span class="blog-li-title">WHO</span> - the ACTORS - people who can significantly affect the success of a milestone. Primary actors have their goals fulfilled e.g. users, secondary actors provide services, e.g. customer service, and off-stage actors have an interest in behaviour or service provision but not directly, e.g. the CEO, Mike from marketing, under-18 customers. The inclusion of actors is to show that success relies on people doing things.</li>
    <li><span class="blog-li-title">HOW</span> - the IMPACTS - how can the actors help us reach the business goal? E.g. inviting more friends or selling tickets faster. This is described at the level of human behaviour.</li>
    <li><span class="blog-li-title">WHAT</span> - the DELIVERABLES - software features and organisational activities. Each deliverable is an option for how we can facilitate the desired behaviour and should be listed only at a high level (don&rsquo;t go into details). E.g. Online ticket sales, optimise call centre sales scripts</li>
</ol>
<p> With these four levels you can create a brainstorm-style map of what you want and how it can be achieved. But the idea with the completed impact map is never to implement everything, but to find the quickest path to achieve the goal - we need to prioritise goals based on business importance, and impacts based on business impact versus resource requirements. We then aim to generate the top priority deliverables, starting with the lowest hanging fruit, and keep going until the goal is achieved.
</p>

An example impact map for my current workplace would be
<ul>
    <li>GOAL - increase AOV to Â£30 without reducing revenue</li>

    <li>WHAT - Buy colour packs</li>
    <li>WHAT - Buy the book for a pattern</li>
