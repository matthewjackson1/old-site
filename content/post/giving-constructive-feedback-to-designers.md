title = "Giving Constructive Feedback to Creatives"

+++
<p>
When giving feedback on a piece of creative work we have to remember how exposed the designer's personal style is. Few people see, let alone have an opinion on, a software developer's code style, or a QA's regression test procedure, but visual design is incredibly visible and many people have opinions about it. To avoid getting the designer on the defensive you have to give feedback which is fundamentally specific, constructive and objective.
</p>
<p>
Here are some top tips to keep your relationship cordial and productive:
</p>

<ol>

<li><h3> Clarify the goals of the work first</h3>
<p>
Are you and the designer both expecting the same results from the project? Make it clear from the outset that you expected a prototype, or that they are aware of the project timeline if they haven't delivered as much as you hoped for.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Talk about what you felt, not what you think the user will feel</h3>
<p>
The best feedback is a diary of emotions and thoughts while reviewing the design. Nobody can argue that your feelings are wrong, but they can (and will) argue passionately for their own ideal use cases. By expressing what you and saw and did, you will have a much more constructive conversation.
</p>
<p>
An important part of reporting your feedback and avoiding that defensive conflict is to use the past tense. For example, "it wasn't obvious how to continue the signup process" vs "this doesn't make it clear how to continue the signup process". The first option is irrefutable as an observation, the second will like an attack on design skills and elicit conflict.
</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Constructive questioning</h3>
<p>
Don't be aggressive or challenging with your questions. Instead of making the designer defend their thought processes, seek to understand them by asking for opinions; this will lead to healthy discussion rather than unhealthy conflict.
</p><p>
Here's an example:<br>
"Why would the customer look there for that?" vs "how do you think the user would know to look there for that?"
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Be specific and objective</h3>
	<p>
"This text is weirdly squished together" vs "I'm used to seeing text with more space between the lines, this design is different and I found it difficult to read"
</p>
<p>
Again, this one is about avoiding engaging the designer's self-defense mechanisms. Explain how you felt using objective words which are not emotive and are not open to interpretation.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Soften up criticism if necessary, especially over email</h3>
	<p>
Without body language or tone of voice, jests can be taken seriously. Be sure to convert cues of humour into words (emoji, laughter etc) or reduce the drama of what you're saying when writing by email.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>Take your time</h3>
	<p>
Take time to assess your gut reactions to a design, and formulate it into constructive feedback. Try looking at it at a quieter time of day or in a setting where it would be used.
</p>
</li>
